#BlueGranite - R Resources

Materials from BlueGranite's [Microsoft R: A Revolution in Advanced Analytics](https://www.blue-granite.com/webinar-microsoft-r-a-revolution-of-advanced-analytics) webinar


###SQL Server 2016
The SQL Server R Services sample files utilize introductory R examples with the new Wide World Importers DW database. The demo utilizes a basic source query from the Fact.Orders table and shows how to work with the same data using R in both a traditional context as well as using RevoScaleR with various rx functions. Shifting to SQL, the same code can be adapted for use in SQL Server and embedded in stored procedures with minimal changes. The final component uses a Reporting Services (SSRS) report to connect to an embedded SQL stored procedure and plot the resulting histogram in SSRS.

In order to work through eveything in the demo, you will need:

>1. Access to the RevoScaleR functions (i.e. by installing Microsoft R Client)

>2. Access to a version of SQL Server 2016 with R Services installed 

>3. The WideWorldImportersDW sample database on the SQL instance

>4. SQL Server Data Tools (for the Reporting Services content only)
