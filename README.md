#BlueGranite - R Resources

Materials from BlueGranite's [Microsoft R: A Revolution in Advanced Analytics](https://www.blue-granite.com/webinar-microsoft-r-a-revolution-of-advanced-analytics) webinar


###SQL Server 2016
The SQL Server R Services sample files utilize introductory R examples with the new Wide World Importers DW database. The demo utilizes a basic source query from the Fact.Orders table.

In order to work through eveything in the demo, you will need:

>1. Access to the RevoScaleR functions (i.e. by installing Microsoft R Client)

>2. Access to a version of SQL Server 2016 with R Services installed 

>3. The WideWorldImportersDW sample database on the SQL instance

>4. SQL Server Data Tools (for the Reporting Services content only)
