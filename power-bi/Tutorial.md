#R in Microsoft Power BI Tutorial

There are two different ways to apply R in Power BI: the *R Script* for loading and transforming data, and the *R Visual* for additional enhancement and data visualization. The following tutorial walks through a basic scenario using both.

###Objectives
- Configure R in Power BI
- Use the R Script for loading data
- Create an R Visual

###Prerequisites
- Download and install the free [Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop) application.
- A local R installation (such as [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/open)).


###Activity 1 - Configure R in Power BI
1. The first time you use Power BI, you will need to locate your local R installation. This is a one-time setup unless you upgrade R in the future.  
2. Open Power BI Desktop. Close the startup window with *Get Data*, recent files, etc. if it appears.  
3. Go to *File*, select *Options and settings*, and then select *Options*.  
4. Under the *Global* heading, select *R Scripting*. Power BI attempts to automatically detect a local R installation. If you have multiple versions of R installed, you can select an alternate version from the menu.  
5. Click *OK* when done.  


###Activity 2 - Load Data with R Script
1. Open Power BI Desktop and select *Get Data*. 


###Activity 3 - Plot a Time Series Forecast with R Visual
