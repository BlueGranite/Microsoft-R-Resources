# Microsoft R Open demo script 
from Advanced Analytics Webinar 28 JUN

There are 2 scripts: one written in base R (.R file extension), and one written in Rmarkdown (.Rmd file extension). 
More information on Rmarkdown is found at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>. 
Recent versions of RStudio provide tools for using Rmarkdown to easily create more readable R output (i.e. HTML file)

The HTML output from the .Rmd script is also provided.
